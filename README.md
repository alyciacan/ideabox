# Ideabox

## Abstract:
Ideabox is an application that not only easily stores your ideas for you, but also allows you to sort through them either via your favorites, or a word you remember writing in the idea’s title or body! Next time you have an exciting thought or brainstorm you don’t want to forget, jot it down in Ideabox, wherever you are, and come back to it whenever you want!

## Context:
Ideabox was our first __group__ project at Turing, completed during Week 4 of Mod 1 (which means we have been devs for just under four weeks!).

## Learning Goals:

We aimed to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. We practiced using a team Git workflow to collaborate both together and asynchronously. We challenged ourselves to update and use the data model to manipulate the DOM. We created a responsive client-side interface using Javascript and did our best to implement the Single Responsibility Principle to write DRY Javascript functions.

## Wins + Challenges:
As a group, we feel we were able to communicate with each other remarkably well. This line of open and honest communication allowed us to set up a workflow that best supported our styles of learning, and ultimately led to us having more time to focus on refactoring. We feel that our communication as a group, as well as our refactoring with emphasis on data-model-first data manipulation and SRP functions, are our biggest wins from this project.

That said, while we were able to successfully refactor Iterations 0-3 and half of Iteration 4 with SRP functions and data-model-first manipulation, we were unable to fully refactor Iteration 4, or navigate a search bar filtering function led by the data model. While we managed to complete this functionality by manipulating the DOM, we can tell our logic for data-model-first manipulation is close and we look forward to learning how to improve in the future!

Finally, we recognize that more dynamic CSS is an area in which we can improve and, while we are glad that our current comp accurately reflects the comp we received, we look forward to practicing more dynamic CSS rule-making, since that will be the best style solution for larger applications used across many different browsers and devices!
